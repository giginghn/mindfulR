I started out using the free version but have upgraded to the premium.  It has a lot of great guided mediations and awesome meditation teachers. I will say the only draw back is not all mediations are created equally. So you have to find the right ones that resonate with you. There is a lot of variety. Also, love the courses offered. You have to pay for them or upgrade to the premium membership get to access to it but definitely worth it.

"17","This app forgot that it’s supposed to be a timer","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id358047380","Rieters","15.0.4",1,"I downloaded this app some years ago, when I was looking for a timer with a good bell, and some flexibility within a meditation session to ring different bells to mark transitions from one practice to another.

At first I was quite happy with it, the recorded bells sound great, and peacefully let me know when it was time to bow, and move on with my life. I was able to preset meditation sessions any way I wanted, with multiple reminder bells, and save them with whatever I chose to name them. Everything I wanted.

The problem is the so much more. I do not everything else the app offers, and continuously foists on me. Guided meditations, background music, or ambient soundscapes, a notice of how many people around the world were using the app while I was.

In fact the one place I NEVER, EVER want the internet or social media is in my meditation space, and the bottom line is that this app will not reliably function without an internet connection. Too many times the app has refused to work unless I sign into my account. It’s a timer, for goodness sake. I don’t want to get off my cushion to find a password to turn on a timer. I don’t want to be counted as one more person meditating with this app. I do not want any of the other crap this app offers.

I do want to be assured that when I go into solitary retreat, with no cell phone reception or WiFi within miles, I will be able to reliably turn on the timer. And this app has failed to do that time, and time again. I have deleted the app from all my devices, and if it were possible to give this app a rating of negative stars, I would.",2019-06-26,"insight_timer"

The way the different screens are set up, on free service you are constantly going from soothing, black background, to jarring white background. It’s as if they’re pushing you to get the paid service.
That being said, the guided sleep meditations are pretty good.

-I like how easy it is to keep track of when you meditated.
-I find the milestones and streaks very motivating.

I recently upgraded to the paid version thinking that at the very least, I should support this dedicated staff and I’m really glad I did. I’m enjoying the courses and other paid features.
I’m an executive coach and for years, have been recommending Insight Timer to every one of my clients, most of whom have never meditated before. There are so many options to help beginners get started, from short meditations that can help busy clients  dip their toes in the water and build their meditation muscles to guided meditations that really help people learn to calm their minds. I’m really looking forward to exploring more of the courses. It would be fantastic if there was a way to build a favorites list, then easily share that with my clients. I’ve found that anything I can do to lower the barriers to getting started (one of which can be an overwhelming array of choices), the higher the likelihood that a client will try something. Maybe this option already exists. Guess I need to do some exploring.

I’ve had the app for four days and have meditated everyday since (sometimes twice in one day!). It’s easily become habit - suddenly - given the great magnitude and variety of resources on this app. I LOVE how you can search for anything (and find it, no doubt), listen to different voices and techniques every time, AND it’s free. There is a premium option, but unlike many other apps, the abundance of free perks on this one makes it easy and simple to use without concern to upgrade — they’re not trying to trick you one bit!

I have used it nearly every day for a year and a half now and it has every tool I could ask for. I use a few different practices in each meditation and the ability to set timers anywhere I want allows me to seamlessly switch between practices. On those days that I just don’t have the spirit to do my own meditation the timer, I can choose a guided meditation from one of my Favorite teachers. And on days when I am struggling with something specific, I know that insight will have a meditation for it that I can find.

This is the only app I can think of that could save or greatly improve your life. 30 years ago I took a course in Transcendental Meditation, it never stuck. I downloaded IT 2 yrs. ago and before long committed daily for life. I don’t commit to much, so that alone was a breakthrough. 

I know some others apps have attracted big VC money and IPO riches but I have not tried, for researched well and I appreciate this is essentially a non-profit where most proceeds go to contributors. 

It’s had some nice improvements and format changes recently such as to its SLEEP section. It has not made some obvious improvements I sent them. Such as they misuse the word FINNISH at least as American English speakers use it. Bless their hearts but they are either trying to avoid the word END and any perceived negativity or the cynic might guess they mislead to increase their metrics? I continue to mistakenly read it as RESUME. 

In the end I have trust for IT and everyone in the community. There are only beautiful people here seeking better lives and relationships.

There are options for guided meditations in any area you could possibly wish to focus upon. Some days, a timer with bells to indicate stop, mid, and closing is helpful for me to guide my own practice. I used the free version for months quite happily. Then decided I wished to sponsor their work as it is so beneficial to me so I subscribed for the accessibility to the paid content (which you can purchase individually if desired). I’ve been most pleased.",2019-04-29,"insight_timer"

I love that there are tons of meditation options and they’re all free! I am also motivated by the star-reward system, my latest streak was 139 days of consecutive meditation, which is fantastic for someone who just started a regular meditation practice. I cannot recommend this app enough.
Side note: I have ADHD and this app has helped me manage it, I am so grateful <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FC>
Another note: I am a school social worker and I use the app with students all the time, and my 8 year old daughter uses it as well!
This is truly a life/world changer!",2019-04-28,"insight_timer"
