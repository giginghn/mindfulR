It has even helped with my insomnia since there are several meditations for falling asleep and falling back asleep when you wake up. I look forward to taking a small amount of time for myself abd to just be calm and present.  I really love the approach. It’s not about being a perfect meditator with a perfectly still mind, it’s about learning to be present. He teaches. I bought the upgrade and I’m really glad I did. I love it.

I don’t have a big support system, which is one of the recent changes in my life. Someone suggested Headspace, which I had downloaded but never opened. I saw a series on sleep and decided to try that. I abandoned the series, as I find it hard to focus on much these days. But I discovered one sleepcast that I liked. I played it almost every night. I still don’t have a routine for sleeping but now I have a deep affection for this sleepcast, strange as that may sound. I decided to try the series on grieving. It was and has been difficult, but I am hopeful that it will help. Even though things remain jumbled up, I find myself going to Headspace and trying things like the live meditations. It’s more than an app for stress management or electronic sounds for sleeping. It feels like a safe, encouraging place to go when you can’t find yourself in the world or your mind.",2019-06-27,"headspace"

I never thought this would be something that plagued me but for a week now I’ve been dealing the best way I can everyday and yesterday I broke down. My boyfriend who had your app suggested that I meditate for a little while. Being a fan and part time practicer of meditation I immediately said yes! Sitting here wondering how in the world that didn’t cross my mind before. He put on a short two minute meditation and in those two minutes I felt more at peace than I had in a long time. It made the rest of my day so much better and has continued to help daily. Thank you so much for this easily assessable tool.

"18","Several issues","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id148309941","N/A 1234","3.64.0",1,"1. No iPad landscape mode. 

You will need this for the new iPadOS that is in beta now and coming out in September. 

2. No dark mode support.  You will need this for iOS 13 coming in 2 months. 

3. Headspace iCloud backup is using over 500mb of my 5gb free storage. This is more than Netflix, Amazon Prime and about 5 other apps COMBINED.  

Why are you using so much cloud storage?

4. When will these 3 items be addressed?

It helped calm me down so that i didnt start screaming or punching walls or anything like that. I love this app because i just click into it whenever i’m mad and it soothes me and it gets rid of my stress. I set it to remind me every morning at 9:30 to do it but i usually don’t have time to do it at 9:30 so i just do it whenever i need to which is about 2 times a day. I also use the sleep thing. I usually can’t go to sleep easily and it help a TON.

there are meditation exercises of varying duration and for a myriad of activities and moods, along with a stellar collection of “sleepcasts” (which has a slider to alter the volume of either ambient noise or voice). exercises can be downloaded for offline listening.

I was kind of disappointed, i knew there would be some pay to listen stuff but nothing this excessive. Lovely art style and calm voices with many different types of things to choose from, from sleep to anxiety to meditation and many more. A nice thought to get but its a bit costly for me.

My boyfriend joked that this app that’s supposed to help me relax and reframe thoughts has me upset because I missed a day. 
If I look at my journey I see that each session date is sequential and doesn’t miss a date. This is the second time this has happened to me. I don’t know why my streak gets erased, and sometimes I feel like it adds a day randomly. 
I don’t think this would bother me so much if I wasn’t paying for this. And I know that this feature of the app is the least important aspect or function of the app. But for a product that’s supposed to help you practice mindfulness and acceptance this doesn’t help the users. Now that my streak has reset for the second time I felt the need to review.

I opened up the app again and went to the basics course, and was pleasantly surprised when I relaxed so much, just by taking the 3 minute course. I was so relaxed and happy afterwards, I started laughing. Just today, I also laughed again afterward a meditation. The large downfall is that many of the features in this app you have to pay for, and I’m talking a lot of stuff.

The range of content is great, but my issue is that apart from the basics 1, 2, and 3 courses, as well as some walking meditations (voiced by a woman) everything I’ve heard so far is all done by the same guy.  He has a job to do, to make sure he is a serene and calm presence, talking into your ear. But how he says things comes across as not being genuine at times. It’s totally random, and thankfully doesn’t happen too often, but sometimes I’ll have to skip one of the sessions because I just can’t relate to the way he’s saying things.  It’ll come across like he is trying too hard to sound calm in his ‘sexy meditation voice’.  He seems like a genuine dude, I think that just the sheer amount of courses they made sort of forced him to create habits in the way he says things, I speculate that it’s dependent on how many he had to record at any given time, but who knows.

1 - It helps. A lot. I feel better not just after the sessions, but throughout the day. My thoughts and nerves feel more manageable. 

2 - The illustration is beautiful. Download this app just for the design elements alone. 

3 - It makes me smile and I look forward to hopping into a headspace session.

4 - The guide’s voice is SO soothing. I feel like he’s in my level with me. A real person who knows the struggle and is here to help. 

I’m so thankful this app exists and that whoever made it put thought and effort into every last detail. I have the free version now and plan on purchasing the paid version.",2019-06-05,"headspace"

When I go to sleep I often use my iPad(for the volume) to play sleepcast (snowville, and winter park are my favorite), but the iPad version doesn’t allow landscape view. I simply work around this, but having a landscape version would be amazing. And secondly, let’s have a dark mode! The white and orange look beautiful when I open the app, and I don’t want to have that taken away, but if possible let’s say I got the notification: time to wind down. That’s when dark mode is enabled. And when the notification: time to meditate pops up dark mode is turned off. I think it will be simpler if the app has a custom feature of enabling dark mode between ex: 8:00 pm - 6:00 am. (Doesn’t have to be called dark mode, simply night mode and the colors can be what’s already for the sleep feature) Not sure how the code behind this would work, but if I can make headspace a little better I would love to see these two features in headspace. Also, it would be neat for us iOS users if we could 3D Touch from the app and little widgets will pop up, like go straight to sleep, pick up where I last left off or a quick breathing exercise, there’s potential there I know it.

I’ve tried a bunch, but once I sign up or take a lesson, it asks me to start my free trial or buy premium, plus, etc. So after the last one, I found headspace. I figured I would try it, to see if it was good. And boy, was it worth finding. I’m so happy I found it and I should get it. First of all, you can do all the different things on the app, with NO FREE TRIALS OR PREMIUM/PLUS/etc. There is a headspace plus/premium, but u don’t need it to use the app. That is one things that I LOVE ABOUT THIS APP! Another thing is that it works very well and has helped me a lot! I have only had it for 3 days and i already feel more self-aware and calm. It helps u control stress, anxiety, and it helps with your health and sleep. And most of all, it teaches u an amazing skill of mediation!  It has helped me a lot, for many reasons. It also will occasionally ask u questions like “how is ur day going” or “what do u want to have more control of today”, and give u a bunch of options. It helps u get ur feelings out and if ur not having a good day, it gives u a boost of some positivity and happiness! It is very helpful and i definitely recommend this app! I hope u read this and fine it useful and I really hope u get the app! IT IS WORTH IT! <U+0001F497>",2019-05-22,"headspace"

Headspace’s deceptive billing practices persist!  Last year when my subscription renewed for almost double the price, I asked to see the auto-billing notification that had been sent to me with the new price 60 days prior to renewal (as required by NYS law),  I was given the runaround by customer service only to be told after several weeks that there was a ""glitch"" and I had actually not be sent an email.  As a bribe to keep me from reporting you to the NYS Attorney General, they offered to renew my subscription for the same price.   I accepted.

This year, prior to the renewal on June 6, (for which SURPRISE! I AGAIN did not receive notification), I decided to cancel my auto renewal. I went through the multi step process (which is actually different than listed on your FAQ page--slimy--) and when I got the the final DISABLE AUTO RENEW link, it say...its not YOU its US...can't process your request right now....

Given the way they position yourselves as a ""wellness"" app, it’s ironic that their customer service and deceptive marketing practices might actually kill you 

2018 review:
The good part of having this app is that you can use all of the mindfulness you’ve been practicing to process the rage you will experience from dealing with their customer service department.  I had a 1 year paid subscription which auto renewed for almost 50% more than the original price.  I’m sure this was all in their mouse type but I also know the rules governing notification of auto-renewed annual subscriptions.  I emailed their customer service team and asked for a copy of the notification since I didn’t remember seeing it. Instead, a snarky rep named Joe responded, canceled my account, referred me to their terms of service and insisted they had emailed me 30 days in advance of the auto renewal.   (Without actually providing the email, which is all I ever wanted). I responded and said that I hadn’t asked him to cancel my subscription, just send me the notification for my records.  No response.  It’s been a week. Here’s the super fun part: They reversed the refund of the renewal, so I have been charged.... but have no access to my account.  When I login, it asks me to subscribe.    And OF COURSE, they have no phone number you can call, just an email blackhole where no one responds   Coincidentally, I saw “Andy” on the news this morning discussing the importance of meditation. He’s right, because if I hadn’t been meditating for the past 18 months, I would have yelled at the TV when he came on the screen.  So from that perspective, it’s awesome.",2019-05-22,"headspace"

"337","Solid overall, AND could use some variety","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36287838","Sako11","3.57.2",4,"I have been using the paid version of Headspace for over a year now, and am overall pretty satisfied with the app. It’s excellent as an intro to the core concepts and techniques within mindfulness, with helpful short videos and support audio recordings that address various obstacles to meditation and applied mindfulness practice. 

However, most users will eventually note the formulaic and somewhat repetitive nature of the various “lesson packs” that cover a range of topics from productivity at work to dealing with cancer. The basic formula is this - Andy talks for 1.5min regarding whatever the concept is, followed by a basic body scan, emotional awareness, and breath counting tools. The latter comprises 60-70% of the selected meditation time (typically 3,5,10,15, or 20min). Literally ALL the packs seem to follow this formula. Dealing with anxiety? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. Wanting to increase focus? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. Wanting to learn how to manage anger more effectively? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. It gets pretty unengaging after a while, honestly.

Now, mindfulness and meditation aren’t supposed to “entertain” us, but it would be fantastically helpful if they introduced a variety of different techniques, like self-compassion meditations, a greater variety of guided visualizations, mantras, mindfulness of thoughts, and in-depth body scans. Plus, these techniques should be woven into the meditation proper, instead of simply being mentioned by Andy in his calm and friendly 1.5min monologue, followed by the exact same thing ever time. If these techniques indeed are in the offered selection, they have managed to completely evade me, and thus I apologize of I just never found them.

Overall, I’d recommend this app to people who are just getting started, or are still fairly new to mindfulness. More experienced meditators may become somewhat bored with the platform and seek out greater depth and variety.

I’m 27 now and have tried sleep pills, anti anxiety pills and several anti depressants. But when it really comes to healing, you have to start with your mind. I saw a commercial for headspace and gave it a shot. I am so glad that I did. My anxiety has always been crippling but even the idea that Headspace is just a tap away on my phone gives me piece of mind. The sessions have been incredible. It’s hard to even explain. The instant I start a session my body relaxes and everything just falls together. Sleep has come easier, which I’m so grateful for.
