I didn‚Äôt think that the sleep stories or the sleep music would help me, but boy was I wrong. At first I did all the free stuff. And then one night after going out to the couch and tossing and turning until 3 a.m. I kind of said screw it and paid the money for a years subscription. It seems like a lot of money, but broken down over an entire year it‚Äôs totally worth it!! 

I can not go to bed with out this thing, believe me I‚Äôve tried! I sleep so restlessly without it. I don‚Äôt use it too much for the meditation, but I have and it‚Äôs wonderful. I mostly use it for sleep. I‚Äôve found that I have favorite narrators that I like and I get so excited when my favorite narrator adds a new sleep story. 

I‚Äôm not someone who spends money willy nilly, but this was a very smart purchase and when my year is up I will be resubscribing. Just trust me, it will be worth every penny!",2019-07-09,"calm"

But it was too good and useful. There are lots of different guided mindfulness meditations, which I‚Äôve actually been using regularly. It‚Äôs really helped me work short meditation practices into my day at different times (and for different purposes: from focus to calm to sleep). I‚Äôve also listened to some of the sleep music and sleep stories to help wind-down and get a good nights sleep when I‚Äôm hyped up over a stressful day.

Request: One thing I‚Äôm really hoping they will add soon is a separate set of guided meditations (or at least one longer one) for actual mind-body physical healing (after injury, surgery, or from illness). I would also benefit from guided meditations on coping with & living with chronic pain. Please consider adding these!",2019-07-08,"calm"

They just go ahead and do it, and take zero responsibility for it if you try to protest or cancel. Instead, they send you to Apple, which will automatically reject your request for a refund.

"27","This app is changing my life and it‚Äôs only been two weeks","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117640725","bandannanannah","4.11.3",5,"When I downloaded this app based off a YouTuber‚Äôs recommendation, I was skeptical. I‚Äôve done yoga for a decade and have always, always struggled with meditation, so much so that it would sometimes set off panic attacks. I‚Äôve truly done my best to only focus on moving meditation via asana, but I move in and out of frequent practicing. I‚Äôve always been a person that is essentially stressed 24/7, but with bipolar disorder, letting that stress take hold can be dangerous. 

I had a bit of an episode a couple weeks ago when I hadn‚Äôt had one in a very, very long time, and feeling out of control over my own emotions like that again scared me. I decided I needed to do everything possible to set myself up for success when it comes to mental health, and knew (and have known for a long af time) meditation is one of the most effective ways to facilitate that.

I‚Äôve tried various apps and methods half-heartedly, with meditation always feeling like torture. When your mind is a nightmare most of the time anyway, it‚Äôs hard to intentionally put yourself in that space, undistracted, for even 5 minutes. 

As soon as I opened Calm for the first time, I was just like, ‚ÄúYeeeessssss...‚Äù I‚Äôm a designer and the UI just so perfectly invokes a sense of peace and tranquility, and the design is so beautiful and enjoyable to interact with; i was so impressed. I started the 7 Days for Anxiety series, which were 11ish minutes apiece, and to my surprise, it was so pleasant!!!!!! Tamara is a meditation wizard and her practices resonated with me in a way nothing else has before. It was not torturous! I enjoyed the ten minutes! And it‚Äôs still been that way since. Also - the sleep stories !!! I was having trouble sleeping when I downloaded and they helped so much !!!! 

I‚Äôve never wanted to pay money for a meditation app but this one was worth it. At $60 for a year you can‚Äôt beat it, and it‚Äôs truly an investment in your health. I can‚Äôt wait to be able to use Calm from now on. It might be my favorite app I‚Äôve ever downloaded.",2019-07-07,"calm"

So effective and can easily fit in my morning routines, I rarely start my day without it now.  I love the beautiful combination of silence mediation/breath work and the inclusion of a strong moral message of the day at the end of each session. I have been using it for over a  year now, however I am excited to yet explore the other aspects of the app, that are geared to other parts of the day/emotions.  Tamara‚Äôs voice is so calming ( good choice of app name ;) and I really appreciate when she uses her own stories for the listener to resonate with.

Since 2016 these things have increased, and I‚Äôm not finding my daily medications as helpful with the increase in tensions around me. Although I have never bought into this idea of happiness (that we are all somehow entitled to it) I have found some things in the mindfulness practice helpful, but again I want to feel that the things I experience every day are not something that I SHOULD be dealing with but rather perhaps as a way to CHANGE things so that I don‚Äôt need to have to listen to a how to deal with this kind of stress in the first place. I find it nearly impossible to ‚Äúvisualize‚Äù a warm feeling of happiness on myself let alone others around me when I have to get up every day and go out in a world that devalues me just because of my skin color.

      I asked my parents for extra allowance. They said no. Especially cause my mom just lost her job I can't pay at least 70$ in one week. After you are finished in a week, you must pay for the subscription.

The $69.99 is to get Calm Premium, and that gives you a lot of nice choices and cool options like stories to listen to, different scenes and music and meditation exercises. But let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt want to pay that much, or you can‚Äôt like me. You only get to listen to two stories, and that‚Äôs it. There are meditation exercises called 7 Day Calming or something like that. Each meditation exercise has 7 levels. But if you can‚Äôt pay the almost $70 a year, then you can do only the first level. And there are only like 4 levels that you can do if you are not subscribed to Calm. So if you don‚Äôt wanna pay $70 a year, all you get to do on this app is listen to two stories, and do four different exercises. Mind you, this is out of the like 100 exercises and 50+ stories there are. Also you can‚Äôt change the music or anything. I wish this app wasn‚Äôt so focused on money or else it would be a great app. But you have to pay a lot of money if you want to meditate. It‚Äôs not fair, and some people really need to meditate, but can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt have enough money. Also, it shows on the pictures that all the exercises are unlocked, but that‚Äôs only AFTER you pay $69.99. Just warning you. Overall I think this could be way better if it was 100% free. I know a lot of people who have been discouraged and haven‚Äôt gotten this app because of the hefty prices. It‚Äôs a nice idea and I do like the colors and the ways it‚Äôs organized.

"207","Think Twice About Subscribing!!!","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id11615347","DYumei","4.11.1",1,"I purchased Calm last year. Used it a couple months and stopped. It‚Äôs nice, but it just didn‚Äôt work for me. But I paid for it so I thought I‚Äôd work with it. I wound up just never using it for the next 9 - 10 months and forgot about it. BIG MISTAKE.

I Should Have Canceled Right Away. Life happens. For me it was medical leave and loss of job. This wasn‚Äôt on my mind. 

A year later, I look at my subscriptions for another reason, and am mortified to see Calm is set to renew that day! Tried to cancel immediately. It did cancel ‚Äî for next year. The payment hadn‚Äôt even gone through yet. It was pending. But iTunes wasn‚Äôt letting go.

Tried to request a refund. ITunes said i was SOL, it didn‚Äôt meet the requirements for a refund and gave me a link to terms and conditions for subscriptions. I read it. There‚Äôs nothing in there about refunds for accidental renewals positive or negative. 

But evidently, in practice there is NO GRACE PERIOD for accidental renewals. 

This is not rocket science. ITunes can easily grant a grace period and refund. Other companies of reputation, integrity and good customer service do that. My daughter got a refund promptly from Master Class after she realized she got charged for a yearly subscription renewal 2 days after the charge went through. But iTunes refused to refund a renewal that was caught on the same day. 

So I‚Äôm charged another $63 for an app I didn‚Äôt even like that much and barely used and likely will not use again. 

I‚Äôve canceled all my other paid subscriptions with iTunes. I figured they made enough off of me. 

If you want to use Calm, set yourself a reminder a year ahead when it‚Äôs time to renew. It‚Äôs an expensive app and mistake.",2019-06-26,"calm"

The app has had great success that's good because it really is a great app. But billing issues repeatedly that not only are confusing, but apparently are to some degree out of the control.of the customer are not good 
I found no.other way to cancel but cancelling on the subscription  page- this had worked with other apps. This doesn't only add to the money issues  of people struggling but increases the anxiety & stress that make the  road back to organized, calm, improved function so much rockier. 

Please refund the 69.99.Thank you.
If you will.also  look.into the other previous billing issues, I would be very grateful.
.*** I was at the beginning of a long stretch of really hard events in my life that kept me working, sleeping, trying to manage best I could, and I lost track of  these kind of admin home tasks: I worked through that time with very ill clients & did good work, that was my priority along with my kids,  I put all my energy into doing those things well - but some non living balls dropped.
I,my family had a series truly hard life events in a row over three years or so, followed by years of after shocks,far flung loss, destruction, re-gathering, trying to stabilize after a tornado or earthquake with after shocks, lesser wind storms that we mayve withstood just fine before, but now we're all broken, confused, unable,less able, some we're the dependable ones but now burned out, no one is as they were, the laughter had died, family gatherings, holidays, etc dont  happen as they did. At 57 Im back where  I started at 26,  much wearier, beat-up, lost, broke, perhaps wiser. Love this app, will someday hope for lifetime membership",2019-06-22,"calm"

Original review:
iTunes needs to fix this deceptive practice. If you are trying the one week free trial of this app please be aware, If you miss the cutoff by even one day, you are on the hook for the $60-$70. They will not refund or prorate any of the charges. Very deceptive. Apple iTunes you're counting on folks forgetting to cancel in time. Calm is offering this for $9.99 to mental health practitioners I suspect to market app to their patients for a much steeper price.  I will file a formal complaint with BBB if this isn't resolved.

I downloaded this with the knowledge of having less accessible features. But I tried the free trial just to see what it would be like (but I was still restless even while using the app so I had planned to delete the app, but I kept giving it a shot)

After the free trial ran out, I was NOT told. It charged me $69.99 out of my account. 

I was unaware and didn‚Äôt permit this purchase. I cancelled the subscription right away (so I barely and did not use the app under the subscription I paid for). Based on the reviews you won‚Äôt get a refund. If I don‚Äôt get a refund that would be a great disappointment :(",2019-06-17,"calm"

Laziness plain & simply. Hard to see the bang for my buck(time spent meditating), so to speak!

Well now 30 years later & i have debilitating pain due to psoriatic arthritis. I ended up in past 15 years having both knees replaced, one hip replacement replaced (only lasted 15 years, that one was 16 years old).  And a hernia op.

A few years ago I ended up getting an infection in fatty part of upper thigh. ‚ÄúA nasty place to get infection‚Äù  my dr told me,  ‚Äúhard to get rid of an infection in that area‚Äù. I take Humira and the two don‚Äôt mix...my primary care physician prescribed antibiotics, one month later still had infection and my dr prescribed stronger antibiotics. Again a month went by with no changes in infection...finally my dr prescribed surgery to have infection removed...last thing to try, cut it out! I didn‚Äôt want to have to go the surgery route. 

So I remembered my Transcendental Meditation teachings and with nothing to loose I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I also happened upon Calm, the app, which not only had a timer with selectable time duration & background sounds you can choose from but it also had a huge variety of specific ‚Äútalk you through‚Äù meditation practices from Focusing your personal energy, stories to put you to sleep, inner peace to step by step meditation for beginners (not only beginners but specific aged beginners) like 3-5 y/o, 6-9 y/o, up thru adult. Just barely scratching the surface of the app. It has sleep stories, special music, and lots of guided 

So I began meditating again and am now using Calm to guide me & keep track myself! Calm provides very helpful feedback that keeps track of time spent & offers kind words of encouragement to help you continue. It is very helpful and I‚Äôm finding the statistics was the reinforcement I was needing to help me to continue!

Infection gone!!! So about 6 weeks after restarting twice daily transcendental meditation for 15-20 minutes each time the infection was gone, simply gone! Quieting my mind 2 times a-day for 6 weeks did something MAGICAL to my mind & body‚ÄºÔ∏è

     i was at a swim party with my friends the other day when one of them told me she had started meditating ( i‚Äôll talk more about that friend later.) i asked what app she used and she said:
     ‚Äúcalm. it is sooo nice‚Äù
     ‚Äú really, cuz i downloaded it a few months ago and i HATED it.,‚Äù i replied
     ‚Äúreally? why?‚Äù
     ‚Äúbecause everything is so expensive‚Äù
     ‚Äúwhat do u mean?‚Äù 
      i proceeded to tell them about my terrible experience with calm and she said that it was different on her phone. i doubted it but i downloaded it on my phone to see if they had updated the app or something. i was wrong. they had not updated the app. everything was the same except now i was more in need of a meditation class than ever because this has gotten me more stressed out than ever. how could hers be free and mine not? ok i know the obvious answer is that my friend paid for it, but she‚Äôs not allowed to spend money on apps, and neither am i. I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMAD!!!! 
      that night i told my mom about the app and she said that the app might recognize me and that when i deleted the app it was still expensive. i replied by saying thats not fair. i am so mad i want to SCREEEEEEAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM, and i am usually a cery mindfull, smart, kind, and fentle person. all thanks to headspace. if u are looking for a meditation app go check it out. u can actually Take the basics there( i wouldn‚Äôt know what happens after that bc i am to forgettful to even take the classes daily!) 
      about my friend, she is an egotistical, taking over, bossy, bleep. she has taken over ALL of my things now. things that were previosly MY thing. things like art, smarts, creativity, environmental love, and now meditation. üò¢üò¢üò¢*she also acts like of the other most annoying girls‚Äî when im trying to fo my homework.  i could go on and on about everything that has to do with the stress and anger i fot from calm but i will end by saying do NOT use calm or i will send a murderer after u and yes i have VERY easy axcess to a murderer

I‚Äôve been a calm user for 5 years or so? I‚Äôm not sure at this point, and I‚Äôve loved the app. It was great to finally get a good nights sleep. But it started getting popular, and I was even fine when the 2-3 free stories would change so one could get a variety even without paying. And you may never listen to the same story again, but I could live with that. Now, you only get one free story and NO free music. That‚Äôs it. Out of the Hundreds of songs and stories you get one. Or else you have to pay a monthly/yearly subscription for the rest. It‚Äôs stupid. I used to love calm, not it‚Äôs just a waste of space on my phone.",2019-06-09,"calm"

"477","Forever Grateful","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35839098","grateful xoxo","4.10",5,"I have woken up to the Daily Calm 207 times since I first downloaded it and it has truly transformed my life. 10 min of my day is dedicated to mindfulness and it has had a huge impact on my overall well being.

Because of a childhood trauma I was a medicated suffer of anxiety, panic attacks, and PTSD. It was horribly debilittayling and nothing really seemed to help. Mindfulness was transformational for me. I am now off the meds and enjoying a rich and full life.

Dealing with anxiety is an on-going lifelong battle but with Calm on my side I feel empowered and ready to face anything. I am not living in fear anymore, I am truly enjoying life - with it‚Äôs ups and downs. Breath by breath, moment by moment anything is manageable.

Calm breaks mindfulness practices into small, digestible, relevant and supportive sound bites.

For example, the other night I woke up with a terrible panic attack. Dark thoughts haunted me in the middle of the night. I remembered Calm. I plugged in and listened to Panic SOS. After the session I felt so much better, I quietly went back to sleep. I have reached for Calm when I needed help resolving conflict. I listened when I was undergoing a root canal last week. I even use the kids mediation with my two children, I hope you can add a few more sessions because it would be so wonderful for them to learn these techniques earlier on!

Calm you are now an integral part of my life.

Tamara Levitt, your beautiful soothing voice, calms and nourishes me. Your words and quotes are full of wisdom and peace. I carry them with me throughout my days. They have been powerful enough to transform some pretty dense emotions within me. I am forever grateful that you exist and that you have put something like this together.",2019-06-08,"calm"
