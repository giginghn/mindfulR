It has even helped with my insomnia since there are several meditations for falling asleep and falling back asleep when you wake up. I look forward to taking a small amount of time for myself abd to just be calm and present.  I really love the approach. It’s not about being a perfect meditator with a perfectly still mind, it’s about learning to be present. He teaches. I bought the upgrade and I’m really glad I did. I love it.

I don’t have a big support system, which is one of the recent changes in my life. Someone suggested Headspace, which I had downloaded but never opened. I saw a series on sleep and decided to try that. I abandoned the series, as I find it hard to focus on much these days. But I discovered one sleepcast that I liked. I played it almost every night. I still don’t have a routine for sleeping but now I have a deep affection for this sleepcast, strange as that may sound. I decided to try the series on grieving. It was and has been difficult, but I am hopeful that it will help. Even though things remain jumbled up, I find myself going to Headspace and trying things like the live meditations. It’s more than an app for stress management or electronic sounds for sleeping. It feels like a safe, encouraging place to go when you can’t find yourself in the world or your mind.",2019-06-27,"headspace",929

My boyfriend who had your app suggested that I meditate for a little while. Being a fan and part time practicer of meditation I immediately said yes! Sitting here wondering how in the world that didn’t cross my mind before. He put on a short two minute meditation and in those two minutes I felt more at peace than I had in a long time. It made the rest of my day so much better and has continued to help daily. Thank you so much for this easily assessable tool.

"18","Several issues","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id148309941","N/A 1234","3.64.0",1,"1. No iPad landscape mode. 

You will need this for the new iPadOS that is in beta now and coming out in September. 

2. No dark mode support.  You will need this for iOS 13 coming in 2 months. 

3. Headspace iCloud backup is using over 500mb of my 5gb free storage. This is more than Netflix, Amazon Prime and about 5 other apps COMBINED.  

Why are you using so much cloud storage?

4. When will these 3 items be addressed?

It helped calm me down so that i didnt start screaming or punching walls or anything like that. I love this app because i just click into it whenever i’m mad and it soothes me and it gets rid of my stress. I set it to remind me every morning at 9:30 to do it but i usually don’t have time to do it at 9:30 so i just do it whenever i need to which is about 2 times a day. I also use the sleep thing. I usually can’t go to sleep easily and it help a TON.

there are meditation exercises of varying duration and for a myriad of activities and moods, along with a stellar collection of “sleepcasts” (which has a slider to alter the volume of either ambient noise or voice). exercises can be downloaded for offline listening.

Wanting to see what else there was to offer i was met with loads of ‘subscribe to unlock’ on almost all of the options. I was kind of disappointed, i knew there would be some pay to listen stuff but nothing this excessive. Lovely art style and calm voices with many different types of things to choose from, from sleep to anxiety to meditation and many more. A nice thought to get but its a bit costly for me.

My boyfriend joked that this app that’s supposed to help me relax and reframe thoughts has me upset because I missed a day. 
If I look at my journey I see that each session date is sequential and doesn’t miss a date. This is the second time this has happened to me. I don’t know why my streak gets erased, and sometimes I feel like it adds a day randomly. 
I don’t think this would bother me so much if I wasn’t paying for this. And I know that this feature of the app is the least important aspect or function of the app. But for a product that’s supposed to help you practice mindfulness and acceptance this doesn’t help the users.

1. It could showcase the courses in a more clear way. I still have a hard time parsing through the different possibilities. I’m no app designer, but it is always cumbersome for me. 
2. I should be able to play meditation audio trough Airplay. I can already play the little animations through AirPlay without problem, so I wonder what the hang up is.

I know that this is how they make money, but having these mental health challenges and not being able to unlock the “stress” category and etc. makes me bummed. If you’re reading this and are able to pay for the subscription, do it, I 100% recommend it. I’m doing the beginner course and it hasn’t been very long, but I am truly shocked at how calm and open I have been feeling.

The range of content is great, but my issue is that apart from the basics 1, 2, and 3 courses, as well as some walking meditations (voiced by a woman) everything I’ve heard so far is all done by the same guy.  He has a job to do, to make sure he is a serene and calm presence, talking into your ear. But how he says things comes across as not being genuine at times. It’s totally random, and thankfully doesn’t happen too often, but sometimes I’ll have to skip one of the sessions because I just can’t relate to the way he’s saying things.  It’ll come across like he is trying too hard to sound calm in his ‘sexy meditation voice’.  He seems like a genuine dude, I think that just the sheer amount of courses they made sort of forced him to create habits in the way he says things, I speculate that it’s dependent on how many he had to record at any given time, but who knows.

2 - The illustration is beautiful. Download this app just for the design elements alone. 

3 - It makes me smile and I look forward to hopping into a headspace session.

4 - The guide’s voice is SO soothing. I feel like he’s in my level with me. A real person who knows the struggle and is here to help.

When I go to sleep I often use my iPad(for the volume) to play sleepcast (snowville, and winter park are my favorite), but the iPad version doesn’t allow landscape view. I simply work around this, but having a landscape version would be amazing. And secondly, let’s have a dark mode! The white and orange look beautiful when I open the app, and I don’t want to have that taken away, but if possible let’s say I got the notification: time to wind down. That’s when dark mode is enabled. And when the notification: time to meditate pops up dark mode is turned off. I think it will be simpler if the app has a custom feature of enabling dark mode between ex: 8:00 pm - 6:00 am. (Doesn’t have to be called dark mode, simply night mode and the colors can be what’s already for the sleep feature) Not sure how the code behind this would work, but if I can make headspace a little better I would love to see these two features in headspace. Also, it would be neat for us iOS users if we could 3D Touch from the app and little widgets will pop up, like go straight to sleep, pick up where I last left off or a quick breathing exercise, there’s potential there I know it.

I figured I would try it, to see if it was good. And boy, was it worth finding. I’m so happy I found it and I should get it. First of all, you can do all the different things on the app, with NO FREE TRIALS OR PREMIUM/PLUS/etc. There is a headspace plus/premium, but u don’t need it to use the app. That is one things that I LOVE ABOUT THIS APP! Another thing is that it works very well and has helped me a lot! I have only had it for 3 days and i already feel more self-aware and calm. It helps u control stress, anxiety, and it helps with your health and sleep. And most of all, it teaches u an amazing skill of mediation!  It has helped me a lot, for many reasons. It also will occasionally ask u questions like “how is ur day going” or “what do u want to have more control of today”, and give u a bunch of options. It helps u get ur feelings out and if ur not having a good day, it gives u a boost of some positivity and happiness! It is very helpful and i definitely recommend this app!

Headspace’s deceptive billing practices persist!  Last year when my subscription renewed for almost double the price, I asked to see the auto-billing notification that had been sent to me with the new price 60 days prior to renewal (as required by NYS law),  I was given the runaround by customer service only to be told after several weeks that there was a ""glitch"" and I had actually not be sent an email.  As a bribe to keep me from reporting you to the NYS Attorney General, they offered to renew my subscription for the same price.   I accepted.

This year, prior to the renewal on June 6, (for which SURPRISE! I AGAIN did not receive notification), I decided to cancel my auto renewal. I went through the multi step process (which is actually different than listed on your FAQ page--slimy--) and when I got the the final DISABLE AUTO RENEW link, it say...its not YOU its US...can't process your request right now....

Given the way they position yourselves as a ""wellness"" app, it’s ironic that their customer service and deceptive marketing practices might actually kill you 

2018 review:
The good part of having this app is that you can use all of the mindfulness you’ve been practicing to process the rage you will experience from dealing with their customer service department.  I had a 1 year paid subscription which auto renewed for almost 50% more than the original price.  I’m sure this was all in their mouse type but I also know the rules governing notification of auto-renewed annual subscriptions.  I emailed their customer service team and asked for a copy of the notification since I didn’t remember seeing it. Instead, a snarky rep named Joe responded, canceled my account, referred me to their terms of service and insisted they had emailed me 30 days in advance of the auto renewal.   (Without actually providing the email, which is all I ever wanted). I responded and said that I hadn’t asked him to cancel my subscription, just send me the notification for my records.  No response.  It’s been a week. Here’s the super fun part: They reversed the refund of the renewal, so I have been charged.... but have no access to my account.  When I login, it asks me to subscribe.    And OF COURSE, they have no phone number you can call, just an email blackhole where no one responds   Coincidentally, I saw “Andy” on the news this morning discussing the importance of meditation. He’s right, because if I hadn’t been meditating for the past 18 months, I would have yelled at the TV when he came on the screen.  So from that perspective, it’s awesome.",2019-05-22,"headspace",2640

"337","Solid overall, AND could use some variety","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36287838","Sako11","3.57.2",4,"I have been using the paid version of Headspace for over a year now, and am overall pretty satisfied with the app. It’s excellent as an intro to the core concepts and techniques within mindfulness, with helpful short videos and support audio recordings that address various obstacles to meditation and applied mindfulness practice. 

However, most users will eventually note the formulaic and somewhat repetitive nature of the various “lesson packs” that cover a range of topics from productivity at work to dealing with cancer. The basic formula is this - Andy talks for 1.5min regarding whatever the concept is, followed by a basic body scan, emotional awareness, and breath counting tools. The latter comprises 60-70% of the selected meditation time (typically 3,5,10,15, or 20min). Literally ALL the packs seem to follow this formula. Dealing with anxiety? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. Wanting to increase focus? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. Wanting to learn how to manage anger more effectively? Andy talks for 1.5min, then sit. It gets pretty unengaging after a while, honestly.

Now, mindfulness and meditation aren’t supposed to “entertain” us, but it would be fantastically helpful if they introduced a variety of different techniques, like self-compassion meditations, a greater variety of guided visualizations, mantras, mindfulness of thoughts, and in-depth body scans. Plus, these techniques should be woven into the meditation proper, instead of simply being mentioned by Andy in his calm and friendly 1.5min monologue, followed by the exact same thing ever time. If these techniques indeed are in the offered selection, they have managed to completely evade me, and thus I apologize of I just never found them.

Overall, I’d recommend this app to people who are just getting started, or are still fairly new to mindfulness. More experienced meditators may become somewhat bored with the platform and seek out greater depth and variety.

The instant I start a session my body relaxes and everything just falls together. Sleep has come easier, which I’m so grateful for.

"500","Not all it’s cracked up to be","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id805322067","Dappled pelt123","4.11.1",2,"It’s a good app, but only if you want to pay $69.99 a year. The $69.99 is to get Calm Premium, and that gives you a lot of nice choices and cool options like stories to listen to, different scenes and music and meditation exercises. But let’s say you don’t want to pay that much, or you can’t like me. You only get to listen to two stories, and that’s it. There are meditation exercises called 7 Day Calming or something like that. Each meditation exercise has 7 levels. But if you can’t pay the almost $70 a year, then you can do only the first level. And there are only like 4 levels that you can do if you are not subscribed to Calm. So if you don’t wanna pay $70 a year, all you get to do on this app is listen to two stories, and do four different exercises. Mind you, this is out of the like 100 exercises and 50+ stories there are. Also you can’t change the music or anything. I wish this app wasn’t so focused on money or else it would be a great app. But you have to pay a lot of money if you want to meditate. It’s not fair, and some people really need to meditate, but can’t because they don’t have enough money. Also, it shows on the pictures that all the exercises are unlocked, but that’s only AFTER you pay $69.99. Just warning you. Overall I think this could be way better if it was 100% free. I know a lot of people who have been discouraged and haven’t gotten this app because of the hefty prices. It’s a nice idea and I do like the colors and the ways it’s organized.

It’s nice, but it just didn’t work for me. But I paid for it so I thought I’d work with it. I wound up just never using it for the next 9 - 10 months and forgot about it. BIG MISTAKE.

I Should Have Canceled Right Away. Life happens. For me it was medical leave and loss of job. This wasn’t on my mind. 

A year later, I look at my subscriptions for another reason, and am mortified to see Calm is set to renew that day! Tried to cancel immediately. It did cancel — for next year. The payment hadn’t even gone through yet. It was pending. But iTunes wasn’t letting go.

Tried to request a refund. ITunes said i was SOL, it didn’t meet the requirements for a refund and gave me a link to terms and conditions for subscriptions. I read it. There’s nothing in there about refunds for accidental renewals positive or negative. 

But evidently, in practice there is NO GRACE PERIOD for accidental renewals. 

This is not rocket science. ITunes can easily grant a grace period and refund. Other companies of reputation, integrity and good customer service do that. My daughter got a refund promptly from Master Class after she realized she got charged for a yearly subscription renewal 2 days after the charge went through. But iTunes refused to refund a renewal that was caught on the same day. 

So I’m charged another $63 for an app I didn’t even like that much and barely used and likely will not use again. 

I’ve canceled all my other paid subscriptions with iTunes. I figured they made enough off of me.

Last summer a similar issue happened where a monthly plan I had at some prior time that had cancelled and I confirmed cancellation as I really couldn't afford it anymore - though I found it so helpful. Suddenly in October I think I saw I was being charged monthly again but since I had not
Re- started membership I had not expected charge which caused much trouble . Also  I hadn’t used it as much as I could have - I didn’t  Re down load app because I didn’t know I was being billed until later. I will check , I believe there were 2-3 billing months in which I was unaware the billing had restarted after cancelling, so I was not using the app as well.as getting large overdraft fee, found with the final charge looking back over account to see what occurred.I was unable  to address this at the time - and I was and am sorry to have to complain - I have loved this app. Please see honest story  of why I let this go until this new 69.99 error.
2. This charge - not authorized , or purchased, nor notified to any family on the apple account  regarding any upcoming ' renewal' ( I do not have any premium.plan - any plan - for you to renew) that would be   applied to thecard on the apple family account , was applied to my son Rob's card, currently on the apple account. The 69.99 taken unawares took a good chunk of money he planned for other uses.and may well.create overdrafts. This second episode of developer/ app initiated charge, now affecting another person on my family acct made me write for help/ review. . The app has had great success that's good because it really is a great app. But billing issues repeatedly that not only are confusing, but apparently are to some degree out of the control.of the customer are not good 
I found no.other way to cancel but cancelling on the subscription  page- this had worked with other apps. This doesn't only add to the money issues  of people struggling but increases the anxiety & stress that make the  road back to organized, calm, improved function so much rockier. 

Please refund the 69.99.Thank you.
If you will.also  look.into the other previous billing issues, I would be very grateful.
.*** I was at the beginning of a long stretch of really hard events in my life that kept me working, sleeping, trying to manage best I could, and I lost track of  these kind of admin home tasks: I worked through that time with very ill clients & did good work, that was my priority along with my kids,  I put all my energy into doing those things well - but some non living balls dropped.
I,my family had a series truly hard life events in a row over three years or so, followed by years of after shocks,far flung loss, destruction, re-gathering, trying to stabilize after a tornado or earthquake with after shocks, lesser wind storms that we mayve withstood just fine before, but now we're all broken, confused, unable,less able, some we're the dependable ones but now burned out, no one is as they were, the laughter had died, family gatherings, holidays, etc dont  happen as they did.

Original review:
iTunes needs to fix this deceptive practice. If you are trying the one week free trial of this app please be aware, If you miss the cutoff by even one day, you are on the hook for the $60-$70. They will not refund or prorate any of the charges. Very deceptive. Apple iTunes you're counting on folks forgetting to cancel in time. Calm is offering this for $9.99 to mental health practitioners I suspect to market app to their patients for a much steeper price.  I will file a formal complaint with BBB if this isn't resolved.

Laziness plain & simply. Hard to see the bang for my buck(time spent meditating), so to speak!

Well now 30 years later & i have debilitating pain due to psoriatic arthritis. I ended up in past 15 years having both knees replaced, one hip replacement replaced (only lasted 15 years, that one was 16 years old).  And a hernia op.

A few years ago I ended up getting an infection in fatty part of upper thigh. “A nasty place to get infection”  my dr told me,  “hard to get rid of an infection in that area”. I take Humira and the two don’t mix...my primary care physician prescribed antibiotics, one month later still had infection and my dr prescribed stronger antibiotics. Again a month went by with no changes in infection...finally my dr prescribed surgery to have infection removed...last thing to try, cut it out! I didn’t want to have to go the surgery route. 

So I remembered my Transcendental Meditation teachings and with nothing to loose I thought I’d give it a try. I also happened upon Calm, the app, which not only had a timer with selectable time duration & background sounds you can choose from but it also had a huge variety of specific “talk you through” meditation practices from Focusing your personal energy, stories to put you to sleep, inner peace to step by step meditation for beginners (not only beginners but specific aged beginners) like 3-5 y/o, 6-9 y/o, up thru adult. Just barely scratching the surface of the app. It has sleep stories, special music, and lots of guided 

So I began meditating again and am now using Calm to guide me & keep track myself! Calm provides very helpful feedback that keeps track of time spent & offers kind words of encouragement to help you continue. It is very helpful and I’m finding the statistics was the reinforcement I was needing to help me to continue!

Infection gone!!! So about 6 weeks after restarting twice daily transcendental meditation for 15-20 minutes each time the infection was gone, simply gone! Quieting my mind 2 times a-day for 6 weeks did something MAGICAL to my mind & body<U+203C><U+FE0F>

     i was at a swim party with my friends the other day when one of them told me she had started meditating ( i’ll talk more about that friend later.) i asked what app she used and she said:
     “calm. it is sooo nice”
     “ really, cuz i downloaded it a few months ago and i HATED it.,” i replied
     “really? why?”
     “because everything is so expensive”
     “what do u mean?” 
      i proceeded to tell them about my terrible experience with calm and she said that it was different on her phone. i doubted it but i downloaded it on my phone to see if they had updated the app or something. i was wrong. they had not updated the app. everything was the same except now i was more in need of a meditation class than ever because this has gotten me more stressed out than ever. how could hers be free and mine not? ok i know the obvious answer is that my friend paid for it, but she’s not allowed to spend money on apps, and neither am i. I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMAD!!!! 
      that night i told my mom about the app and she said that the app might recognize me and that when i deleted the app it was still expensive. i replied by saying thats not fair. i am so mad i want to SCREEEEEEAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM, and i am usually a cery mindfull, smart, kind, and fentle person. all thanks to headspace. if u are looking for a meditation app go check it out. u can actually Take the basics there( i wouldn’t know what happens after that bc i am to forgettful to even take the classes daily!) 
      about my friend, she is an egotistical, taking over, bossy, bleep. she has taken over ALL of my things now. things that were previosly MY thing. things like art, smarts, creativity, environmental love, and now meditation. <U+0001F622><U+0001F622><U+0001F622>*she also acts like of the other most annoying girls— when im trying to fo my homework.  i could go on and on about everything that has to do with the stress and anger i fot from calm but i will end by saying do NOT use calm or i will send a murderer after u and yes i have VERY easy axcess to a murderer

One thing it’s missing (which I’ve found to be VERY helpful on another similar app called Breethe), is the ability to have music or stories be shuffled or auto-repeated (either once, or until you choose to stop it). I have a tough time sleeping, but do better when I can hear a soft voice talking (or other soothing sounds) throughout the night. I most often fall asleep during a story (yay!), but as soon as the story or music ends on this app..I wake back up. So I started using the Breethe app for sleep because I can choose to have either stories or music be repeated over and over..and thus, I sleep longer!

Because of a childhood trauma I was a medicated suffer of anxiety, panic attacks, and PTSD. It was horribly debilittayling and nothing really seemed to help. Mindfulness was transformational for me. I am now off the meds and enjoying a rich and full life.

Dealing with anxiety is an on-going lifelong battle but with Calm on my side I feel empowered and ready to face anything. I am not living in fear anymore, I am truly enjoying life - with it’s ups and downs. Breath by breath, moment by moment anything is manageable.

Calm breaks mindfulness practices into small, digestible, relevant and supportive sound bites.

For example, the other night I woke up with a terrible panic attack. Dark thoughts haunted me in the middle of the night. I remembered Calm. I plugged in and listened to Panic SOS. After the session I felt so much better, I quietly went back to sleep. I have reached for Calm when I needed help resolving conflict. I listened when I was undergoing a root canal last week. I even use the kids mediation with my two children, I hope you can add a few more sessions because it would be so wonderful for them to learn these techniques earlier on!

Calm you are now an integral part of my life.

Tamara Levitt, your beautiful soothing voice, calms and nourishes me. Your words and quotes are full of wisdom and peace. I carry them with me throughout my days.

I opened it up, and was immediately greeted with the blue screen that says Take A Deep Breath. Sounds pretty good so far, right? It gets worse. I then went to the rest of the app, and found that I could only listen to 1 meditation video for free. I then went to Music, and found I could NOT listen to any music for free. I could also only listen to 1 bedtime story for free, and I got very frustrated, because I was looking forward to using this for my babysitting clients when I am having trouble putting them to bed. If I wanted to use the full app, I have to pay $70.00, which equals out to about 6 dollars a month. That doesn't seem like a lot at first, but when you are not eligible to have a good paying job, that can be expensive. And you have to pay 70 bucks EVERY YEAR. I do most of my babysitting for almost free, and I also need money for things to do with my friends. Overall, I was not impressed with the app, and I don't think I would recommend it to anybody. I hope that Calm pays attention to my review, and hopefully fixes some of these things I was not very happy with.

Unknowing, after it seemed like twoweeksfreetrial should be over, I wondered why I was still able to open the app. I HAD recieved from them an offerto buy the app at $49( or maybe it was closer to $45), but I did not accept that offer, still unaware that I was about to be charged full price for app instead!   I asked questions online and also looked at the contents of app and finally found my account info.  That is how I discovered that I was charged for full price, full year subscription!  I see that one can also just join for a month at a time.  That is what I would have chosen to do as a subscriber, but I was not given that choice.  My choices were hidden in the app in my account info.  I believe that is a deceptive practice.  When I tried to get help, my only choice to communicate was not fruitful.  All I got in response was an automated answer that said I had no recourse, nor any live person to talk too.

So basically I am saying, if you download the app from itunes app store, you are starting your two week free trial. And most importantly, you are committing toroll that over intoa full priced yearlong subscription after that.  If i had not changed my Calm settings AND if I do not check the charges monthly on that credit card, I could havebeen paying yearly automatically the rest of my life!  Calm of course does not take responsiblity for their app if you downloaded it from App Store.  I honestly didnt know there was any other way to download it.

The meditation app called...CALM, huh???
I’m not going to tell you what you should do. I’m fairly certain you’re going to do whatever you want regardless of what I advise...I would.
HOWEVER, A WORD TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT RICH:
CALM   IS NOT THE NAME OF THE PARENT COMPANY THAT OWNS THIS APP.
In and of itself, who cares...but when SOME RANDOM COMPANY CHARGES YOUR CREDIT CARD $69.99 and you don’t recognize the charge, so OBVIOUSLY you REFUTE THE CHARGE TO CAPITAL ONE who refunds the $$ and says they are “ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE IN THESE SITUATIONS” but THEN the RANDOM NOT CALM company hits back refuting your refute to CAPITAL ONE, who takes the RANDOM CO.’s side this time (???!!!), yanks back the $69.99 they refunded your CapOne card and sends you a creepy snail mail letter about CALM/ RANDOM CO. Refuting Your Refute Due to the Fact That:
1) you didn’t follow the SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT 
2) you didn’t follow the SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT 
huh?
 I NEVER SUBSCRIBED...
”CALM” apparently was having some sort of FREE 7 DAY TRIAL why would I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE, when I NEVER gave up my CC number or ANY OTHER INFO 
NASTY NASTY LITTLE APP stealing my information...
After a couple moments of my OWN KIND OF MEDITATION,logical thought, I decided to just go to the Play Store and find something better,instead of having something pushed on me by my phone. I texted CALM “customer support”(maybe? I really don’t know anymore!)
and requested that my FREE TRIAL or ANYTHING RELATED to CALM including ANY AND ALL POSSIBLE PAYMENT METHODS be DELETED and the SUBSCRIPTION STOPPED IMMEDIATELY. 
I STILL have my text to the rep and his response to me: 
CALM DUMARSE:
“Zaiyarose, blahhhhhhhhh..... We do not show any record or your name or email address being linked to any account number in our systems. This means that you do not have a subscription with CALM. If you would like, I can set you up for a free trial today......BLAAAAAAhhhh....

"997","This app forgot that it’s supposed to be a timer","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id358047380","Rieters","15.0.4",1,"I downloaded this app some years ago, when I was looking for a timer with a good bell, and some flexibility within a meditation session to ring different bells to mark transitions from one practice to another.

At first I was quite happy with it, the recorded bells sound great, and peacefully let me know when it was time to bow, and move on with my life. I was able to preset meditation sessions any way I wanted, with multiple reminder bells, and save them with whatever I chose to name them. Everything I wanted.

The problem is the so much more. I do not everything else the app offers, and continuously foists on me. Guided meditations, background music, or ambient soundscapes, a notice of how many people around the world were using the app while I was.

In fact the one place I NEVER, EVER want the internet or social media is in my meditation space, and the bottom line is that this app will not reliably function without an internet connection. Too many times the app has refused to work unless I sign into my account. It’s a timer, for goodness sake. I don’t want to get off my cushion to find a password to turn on a timer. I don’t want to be counted as one more person meditating with this app. I do not want any of the other crap this app offers.

I do want to be assured that when I go into solitary retreat, with no cell phone reception or WiFi within miles, I will be able to reliably turn on the timer. And this app has failed to do that time, and time again. I have deleted the app from all my devices, and if it were possible to give this app a rating of negative stars, I would.",2019-06-26,"insight_timer",1600

I recently upgraded to the paid version thinking that at the very least, I should support this dedicated staff and I’m really glad I did. I’m enjoying the courses and other paid features.
I’m an executive coach and for years, have been recommending Insight Timer to every one of my clients, most of whom have never meditated before. There are so many options to help beginners get started, from short meditations that can help busy clients  dip their toes in the water and build their meditation muscles to guided meditations that really help people learn to calm their minds. I’m really looking forward to exploring more of the courses. It would be fantastic if there was a way to build a favorites list, then easily share that with my clients. I’ve found that anything I can do to lower the barriers to getting started (one of which can be an overwhelming array of choices), the higher the likelihood that a client will try something. Maybe this option already exists. Guess I need to do some exploring.

I have used it nearly every day for a year and a half now and it has every tool I could ask for. I use a few different practices in each meditation and the ability to set timers anywhere I want allows me to seamlessly switch between practices. On those days that I just don’t have the spirit to do my own meditation the timer, I can choose a guided meditation from one of my Favorite teachers. And on days when I am struggling with something specific, I know that insight will have a meditation for it that I can find. 
All in all, this app is nothing short of amazing. I recommend it to anyone looking to get started or build their meditation practice and honestly I recommend it to everyone else too!

I downloaded IT 2 yrs. ago and before long committed daily for life. I don’t commit to much, so that alone was a breakthrough. 

I know some others apps have attracted big VC money and IPO riches but I have not tried, for researched well and I appreciate this is essentially a non-profit where most proceeds go to contributors. 

It’s had some nice improvements and format changes recently such as to its SLEEP section. It has not made some obvious improvements I sent them. Such as they misuse the word FINNISH at least as American English speakers use it. Bless their hearts but they are either trying to avoid the word END and any perceived negativity or the cynic might guess they mislead to increase their metrics? I continue to mistakenly read it as RESUME. 

In the end I have trust for IT and everyone in the community. There are only beautiful people here seeking better lives and relationships.

Developers:
I believe that 5.99 for the mantra course is a little bit to much for only that course I mean, are there any other benefits coming soon if I do the payment? I personally believe it’s to much for just one course.

Also I’d love if you could add more flexibility with the volumes for voice and background; as well as the breathing techniques not necessarily requiring to see the screen;
It would be great to have some type of animation or image of adequate positions for each meditation before starting the meditation itself; for example the loving kindness before beginning, displaying some demonstrations of a position with hands on the heart or just specifying where the heart is and an adequate position to place the hands, something like that would be very helpful. 

Keep up the great work! You’re really making a difference and making meditation so dynamic, the fact that now smartphones got involved as a tool is wonderful! thank you so very much.

I’ve used other apps that make you pay a ridiculous amount to use them and that are heavily promoted on social media and radio but I usually was never able to get into the flow of the meditation. Maybe because there was one more reoccurring fee coming out of my bank account. I like that this app doesn’t have so many different selections it’s straight and to the point and has makes me want to meditate more.

Yet you need a steady income for food $120 a month. You need a hefty rich income to buy clothes regularly. So I rarely do but clothes manages $40 a month. Then Shelter. Shelter requires $2,000 a month in most places.

So if we NEED these things to survive why do we charge nearly $2,500 for everything monthly.

As the need for us to relax comes greater in the world everyone is looking how they can make money charging people for oxygen and charging people for water they drink.

When I open my eyes to check the countdown timer, it hurts my eyes and the thin-lined black clock numbers are hard to read.

The newer app seems mottled. I received a developer response to my months-old review below, saying improved logging of breathe sessions was coming in the future. It should already be here by now. Still disappointed with the direction Oak is going.  

According to Oak, if you plan to meditate for 10 min but finish after 8, it’s like you never meditated: you get no credit. Nothing is logged in the app or in Health. This is half-baked and foolish. This is a shame because there’s so much potential. It’s bad enough that all meditation apps  include only the time you log/spend in that app. That focuses on the maker, not the user. #BadUX

The app is generally beautiful, but with too many serious issues. I like the mix of information, breathing and mediation. Unfortunately, only meditation counts for “growing your oak,” even thought Wisdom and Breathing are presented on par with Mediation. Again I question what the developers are thinking.

I've been using this for a while now. One thing that for me is very bothersome. I hate that my meditation is gamified. I have a regular and stable practice. There is the occasional day I miss, and the notice about ""meditation streaks"" is very unhelpful. It causes me to focus on doing meditation for the wrong reasons. 

I'd love it if I could turn off the streak counter. As it turns my meditation practice from a practice and into a game or competition.

I am LOVING the new guided breath segment for sleep. It’s so helpful! A few things I’d like to see:
1. An option for the guided voice during the breathing exercises. I like using it silently at work if I need a break, so the current setup is perfect. Having the guided voice for the sleep one makes me realize that I’d use the breath ones more at home/at night if I didn’t have to watch the screen to do it. 
2. It would be nice if the guided breath for sleep allowed for a quick “warm up” like the meditations do. It’s hard to turn off lights, hit play, put my phone in its spot, AND get comfortable before the voice starts, and I don’t want to miss anything!!

For the first time I can see I am truly enjoying a mediation app (and I will admit, the fact that there are no “pro” “premium” or subscriptions is partly why I enjoy it; I never liked the idea of profiting off of mediation, it seems ingenuine to me). The app is super clean with a beautiful design. However, from my initial experience, here are two things I would tweak: 
1. The guiding voice is significantly louder than the background noise. I wish there was a way to control the balance between these two. I don’t like the guiding voice to be too loud, but when I adjust the voice volume to my liking the background sound is almost inaudible. 
2. For the breathing exercise, I wish there was an option for an audio guide as well. Just like while meditation, while breathing I prefer to not stare at my screen, but currently there is no way for me to follow the breathing exercises without having my eyes glued to the screen, I hope this will change. 

Overall, this is an excellent mediation app, and I hope it remains clean and bloat free, with non of the “premium” features that are constantly being pushed with similar mediation apps. Thanks for making the world a better place.",2018-07-06,"oak",1260

I also have been learning to manage anxiety and worry for the first time in my 28 years of life. Meditation Studio has been instrumental in helping me develop my mindfulness and meditation practice, which has helped me through some challenging moments of anxiety and worry. While it is not a cure all, Meditation Studio is a powerful tool well worth its price. It is easy to use and one of my favorite functions is the ability to choose different background music or sounds. Even when I learn to manage the anxiety I am experiencing much better than I currently do, I will continue using Meditation Studio as daily practice for a range of purposes like stress, gratitude, compassion, sleep, and more.

They were ok. I tired of the various ‘asks’ for money in some, the inadequate samples and the lack of variety. 

So I saw a review of this one and the awards it received. I said might as well. And the reviews were absolutely right. They have meditations for all kinds of mental and emotional needs, at various lengths with different teachers. You can even make your own. And it was <$US25 for the year. Some apps charged $US3-8 per meditation and no sample. You can even make your own Or have favorites and play lists. They are easy to sort by length, type, favorites or teachers. 

I made a suggestion once about having a dark background to make it easier on the eyes at night. And they actually did within a few weeks (not that I was the cause of it but I feel like someone listened). And you can now string them together. 

This app has helped me in so many ways to keep my life straight. I wish blessings on the makers.

After complaining about the downloadable content not being accessible, a few days passed and the content began to work properly. I am assuming it was a backend issue with their servers as the app didn’t need an update to work properly. They’ve got my subscription.

I downloaded the app and wanted to try out the free content before making the decision to purchase a subscription. After I download a track, I attempt to play the file and an alert controller as presented showing that the downloaded content was out of date and requires the file to be updated. So then it takes me back out to the original screen where I could download the file again. This logic loop continues no matter how many times I read download the track. I attempted to send an email to support through their website and have yet to hear a reply. I attempted to send a message inside the app to support, but the send button is disabled.

Ever since Gaiam hyperlinked it to their website.  I have tried a few others (Headspace),  what I love about Meditation Studio is 1) Many choices for teachers... I am an aural person, I love hearing someones voice, the quality of their voice, and how just the sound of the voice can be soothing. The recording quality is excellent.  It feels like the person is sitting right next to you.  2) Variety - both short and long meditations from a minute or two to more than 30 minutes. Sometimes you really need and only have time for a few minutes meditation. 3) Many topics - the most important to me, and why I keep returning to this app, some of the meditations are more like coaching sessions— geared towards moving through difficult or stressful moments in life.

Just guided meditations of seriously varying lengths (say, 4 minutes to 50 minutes..), that are arranged in courses or by purpose (lower stress, go to sleep) or for population (teenagers, first responders).

You can download the ones you like to your ""studio"" though I haven't figured out how to delete them. Maybe they're automatically deleted after a period of unuse. What I REALLY WISH it could do is let you star your favorites or make ""playlists."" Even being able to add your own note to give a description would be helpful.

On April 4 ,2019 I paid for Premium Shine...there was a half price offer and I sent in the application with either of these email addresses; kdt821@ gmail.com OR eyakt.com.   It was paid thru Bank of America.  You congratulate me on joining and yet you lock all of the texts.  I don’t understand why you are not responsive to my request.  Why would I write to you 5 times if I was not truthful?  I love your helpful texts but do not understand why you deny me what I did pay for.  Your actions take away all the good that you do.  I would not recommend Shine to anyone because of your lack of responsibility in giving customers what they paid for and also your lack of checking out the situation so it can be resolved.  This betrays the trust any customer might have with you.

Other apps have said to help with anxiety, depression and mindfulness but fell short in one way or the other. I love this app because they covered all angles honestly. It reminds me daily to check in. It encourages me to take short moments to reflect and be mindful. It’s bright and plenty of the topics it has for the “podcasts” or “talks” are things that are scientifically proven to improve happiness. There are four things I would improve so far: the space given to “talk it out” when you are doing daily check ins., offer more free content so users can get a full feel of the app before buying in., allow users to look back through the data that we enter in so we can better reflect on overall moods and see if we are improving., and during check-ins be able to do more than one option for reflecting, like talk it out and read articles instead of just one. Other than those things I absolutely love the app and plan on purchasing the full app after I’ve used it for a full week. It is definitely something I will be using everyday and will be recommending to friends and telling my physicians and psychologists to recommend to patients.

If you’re like me, you’ve found yourself at a low point in your life -  Stressed, depressed, anxious - it feels like you could drown in all of the negativity, but you choose not to. Instead, you are frantically grasping for something to help keep you afloat. 

For so many people, a good majority of these negative feelings stem from, and ultimately perpetuate money problems! While it can be argued that a subscription to the premium features of this app would be an “investment” towards a solution to these problems, it’s really easier said than done to say “You know what, instead of the gas money I need to get to work this week, I’ll splurge on some self-love!”

Yeah, right.
I live in the projects using my minimum wage paycheck to scrape by every week. That includes the expenses that come with school, which is a double edged sword itself, as I consider the money spent as a form of self-love, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming at the same time.

I’ll admit that I don’t know the ins and outs of Shine’s mission or business model, or what it costs to keep an app running. But, IMHO, the premium resources they offer could do a lot more good in the world if they were more accessible to those of us who need them the most.<U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>",2019-05-27,"shine",1433

I payed for the annual subscription, and daily check-ins quickly became an essential part of my daily routine. I noticed a huge improvement in my mood and that I was handling daily stress better.

On May 7, 2019 my app crashed each time I tried to access the daily check-in/Shine Text screen. I could still use the recorded meditations, but those aren’t why I purchased a subscription to this app as I’m not often in a place where I can listen to them. I decided to give it a few days and see if the issue corrected.

On May 10, 2019, I was still experiencing the same issue. I tried power-cycling my device, and it made no difference. I deleted and reinstalled the Shine app, and it made no difference. I tried both steps again, just in case, and still nothing. That morning, I emailed Shine for help.

On May 15, 2019, I tried the same troubleshooting steps again, still to no avail. I sent a second email to Shine’s support, as I had not received a response yet.

On May 17, 2019, an update was released for this app, but it did not correct my problem.

Today is May 22, 2019, and I still have not received any response from Shine. I wanted to love this app, and I would have been a loyal user for as long as possible because of how uplifting I found it.

It is helping me to stay in a positive head space of self-improvement and self-care. I appreciate all of the gentle encouragement and wisdom.

Here are the tweaks I would like to see so far:
* The new For You section should save the challenges I have started. I would like to have the next day of each challenge appear here so I don’t have to remember which challenges I am doing or how far I have progressed in each one. 
* I would like to bookmark articles as well as talks, including the articles from other sources that are suggested at the end of each Shine article. There are times I see an article I’d like to read, but don’t have time. I’d love to be able to save it in Shine to read later. Ditto helpful articles I have read but would like to come back to later.

I like the new design! Definitely enjoying the colors and the absence of “stock people”. I also like the waves of color that climb the screen as each talk progresses and the big gold wave that fills up the screen when I open the app. <U+263A><U+FE0F>

Thank you!

Update from day 35: 

Still enjoying it! 
 * The briefness of the tracks and articles really helps me to fit them into my day. 
 * I like that each day has a few articles and a recommended audio track that get logged onto my feed, allowing me to scroll backwards to check out the ones I didn’t have time for, or to revisit ones that were meaningful. 
* I like the constant reminders in the audio tracks to breathe. Sometime I think “oh this again” but the truth is that every time I take a deep breath I realize how much it helps and how shallow my breathing has been.
 * I like that after I listen to an audio track from a challenge, it is logged on my feed, along with its takeaways. Those little 3-point summaries are very useful. 

Suggestions for the developers:
* Have the summaries for each track include the mantra from the end of the track, because I am never in a spot to write it down and I always forget it! <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>
* The tracking mechanism for the 7-day challenges is wonky. For example: 4 days in, the summary page is displaying tracks out of order, highlighting track 2 as today’s track instead of track 4, and showing that I haven’t listened to track 3. And sometime tracks I have listened to (and have been logged on my feed) show that they are only partially completed.
 * Developers, know that folx might have differing listening habits. Examples: I like to listen to tracks a few times, but I don’t need the track logged to my feed every time I listen to it. It would be great if there was a replay button that simply repeated the track without logging it. Maybe even a “save to feed” button. Sometimes I like to listen to a track 2x in a row, but the navigation to do so is cumbersome. And other times I like to repeat track 2 right before I listen to track 3 - I find the lessons sink in better that way.
 * When I start a 7-day challenge, it would be great if I could opt to receive a reminder to listen to the next track in the series in my iPhone’s Notification Center each day. Sometimes I can’t get back to a challenge for a few days, but having the notifications would help me to keep track of the ones I had missed. Even better if I could Open the notification and it took me right to the track.

And sometimes the morning midday or evening meditations glitch. But despite these small things there’s enough content that even when these don’t work I find great guided meditations that do exactly what I need.

With their 4-8min meditations I could go through the content in a couple weeks. On top of that the daily check ins for morning afternoon and evening seem to be the same every day. Since I practice mindfulness as a way combat stress anxiety and depression this seemed like an AMAZING feature. But two days in and I’m already bored. For such short guided meditations throughout the app and with fee of 9.99/mo I’m shocked at how few meditations there are and how there doesn’t seem to be a lot of new content popping up in the app. Aside from price and content quantity I have to say Shine delivers everywhere else. Their daily check in is awesome. The content they do have is Very Good and the style the narrators use is amazing. The app is gorgeous and has great articles I can read every morning to get me in the right space mentally to start my day. I only wish there was more content, longer meditations, more meditations specifically geared towards activism, a way to find downloaded content (seriously there’s a download button! But where is it now???), a way that my daily check in responses were recorded - an online gratitude journal anyone? And daily positive affirmations ready and waiting for me in my morning text or check in. Honestly this app probably deserves 4 stars but I was so disappointed about the lack of content after signing up for a year subscription I’m probably being a little harsher than warranted. So if you meditate less than I do or maybe just starting your practice this is a great place to start. Seriously great app. Just maybe not for the price with content being where it is.",2019-04-02,"shine",2621

You areeeee. Yes, you are! Your Monday motivation hack: Talk to yourself like a pet. Seriously."" Seriously? Eat dog food. I initially liked shine for its strategic essays on overcoming daily travails like being overwhelmed by an unachievable to-do list. Now its posts are trite, if not utterly tone deaf because they seem to be written from a place of coddled self-absorbedness. The latest post, about talking to yourself like a pet, is demeaning in its endeavor to encourage patronizing tones on oneself rather than truly home an empowering message. It's the writer's inane strategy based on her realization that she treats her dog better than herself; speaking the language of dumb and basic was never considered a strategy for self respect, which makes this even more asinine. But hey, if someone needs to squeeze out ""good boy!"" rhetoric after defecating, then this is the service for them. Good for Haley, the writer.

The emphasis on balance alleviated my fears and allowed me to reach out to others. I now have a social network and four “girl-buddies” 10-12 years younger than me.

It reminds me to practice gratitude and take care of myself during daily check ins. I like how it tells you your all time number of check ins, rather than a streak because if I miss a day (which I haven’t yet because it helps so much), I don’t feel guilty for ruining my streak. 

The guided meditation challenges are helpful because they give simple and relatable tips to focus on and practice. The 7 day challenges help keep me focused and working towards self care, mindfulness, and so much more. It’s even helpful for eating healthier and encouraging more exercise into your daily life. Those who record the tracks have very pleasant voices and I always feel better after listening. 

I ended up purchasing the app, and think it is well worth the cost.

One suggestion! When looking through past shine articles, I click through many of the links. It would be nice to be able to go back to the previous shine article you were looking at, rather than back to the home page or check in page. I like to weave through pages, but a lot of time I want to read a few different links from the same article but then have to navigate my way back through the chain. So a simple “back” button would be helpful instead of the arrow clicking “back to home”.

I had a hard time registering, and even worst time canceling. I spent, “wasted” much time trying to find where to cancel. No success, no phone number. I read, several times the FAQ.  I followed instructions on how to unsubscribe in my iPhone/apple settings. Not listed? 

I cancelled via email before the end of the trial. 

After all this. I was charged $28 
The phone number on the bottom of the receipt goes into a voice mail box that’s not set up. Very unprofessional. 

I did get an auto response from the email I sent yesterday, requesting cancellation. So I have replied to it. Otherwise, I will dispute through American Express.",2019-02-08,"shine",739

What I don’t like is that every person narrating is a sounds millennial and I could be their mom. 

I get all excited to try a new episode and then it starts with some kid dishing advice. They need more seasoned narrators. The reason being, when you already made your money, traveled abroad and have already had kids, your perspective is so different that you don’t resonate with a woman half your age saying, “You got this.”",2019-02-07,"shine",515
