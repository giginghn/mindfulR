Well, I would argue I’m really consistent with self-reflection and self-care at nighttime before bed because it’s in my routine. I had difficulty setting myself up for a great day in the mornings though, and calming my thoughts before going through my to-do list. I looked for an app to help guide me through self-reflection/mediations in the mornings before starting my work day because I needed the extra help. I really like the 5-minute Shine talks. They wake up my brain in a way that’s not overwhelming and they remind me to pace myself. I’m really happy I found this app for those 5-minute check-ins with myself.",2019-06-24,"shine"

This is the fifth brine I have written to you and now I am angry.  On April 4 ,2019 I paid for Premium Shine...there was a half price offer and I sent in the application with either of these email addresses; kdt821@ gmail.com OR eyakt.com.   It was paid thru Bank of America.  You congratulate me on joining and yet you lock all of the texts.  I don’t understand why you are not responsive to my request.  Why would I write to you 5 times if I was not truthful?  I love your helpful texts but do not understand why you deny me what I did pay for.  Your actions take away all the good that you do.  I would not recommend Shine to anyone because of your lack of responsibility in giving customers what they paid for and also your lack of checking out the situation so it can be resolved.  This betrays the trust any customer might have with you.

Other apps have said to help with anxiety, depression and mindfulness but fell short in one way or the other. I love this app because they covered all angles honestly. It reminds me daily to check in. It encourages me to take short moments to reflect and be mindful. It’s bright and plenty of the topics it has for the “podcasts” or “talks” are things that are scientifically proven to improve happiness. There are four things I would improve so far: the space given to “talk it out” when you are doing daily check ins., offer more free content so users can get a full feel of the app before buying in., allow users to look back through the data that we enter in so we can better reflect on overall moods and see if we are improving., and during check-ins be able to do more than one option for reflecting, like talk it out and read articles instead of just one. Other than those things I absolutely love the app and plan on purchasing the full app after I’ve used it for a full week. It is definitely something I will be using everyday and will be recommending to friends and telling my physicians and psychologists to recommend to patients.

If you’re like me, you’ve found yourself at a low point in your life -  Stressed, depressed, anxious - it feels like you could drown in all of the negativity, but you choose not to. Instead, you are frantically grasping for something to help keep you afloat. 

For so many people, a good majority of these negative feelings stem from, and ultimately perpetuate money problems! While it can be argued that a subscription to the premium features of this app would be an “investment” towards a solution to these problems, it’s really easier said than done to say “You know what, instead of the gas money I need to get to work this week, I’ll splurge on some self-love!”

Yeah, right.
I live in the projects using my minimum wage paycheck to scrape by every week. That includes the expenses that come with school, which is a double edged sword itself, as I consider the money spent as a form of self-love, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming at the same time.

I’ll admit that I don’t know the ins and outs of Shine’s mission or business model, or what it costs to keep an app running. But, IMHO, the premium resources they offer could do a lot more good in the world if they were more accessible to those of us who need them the most.<U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>",2019-05-27,"shine"

On May 7, 2019 my app crashed each time I tried to access the daily check-in/Shine Text screen. I could still use the recorded meditations, but those aren’t why I purchased a subscription to this app as I’m not often in a place where I can listen to them. I decided to give it a few days and see if the issue corrected.

On May 10, 2019, I was still experiencing the same issue. I tried power-cycling my device, and it made no difference. I deleted and reinstalled the Shine app, and it made no difference. I tried both steps again, just in case, and still nothing. That morning, I emailed Shine for help.

On May 15, 2019, I tried the same troubleshooting steps again, still to no avail. I sent a second email to Shine’s support, as I had not received a response yet.

On May 17, 2019, an update was released for this app, but it did not correct my problem.

Today is May 22, 2019, and I still have not received any response from Shine. I wanted to love this app, and I would have been a loyal user for as long as possible because of how uplifting I found it.

"233","Inspiring, but could use a few more tweaks","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id19005556","PepiPaige","2.2.1",4,"After 16 days I’m still motivated to keep using Shine. It is helping me to stay in a positive head space of self-improvement and self-care. I appreciate all of the gentle encouragement and wisdom.

Here are the tweaks I would like to see so far:
* The new For You section should save the challenges I have started. I would like to have the next day of each challenge appear here so I don’t have to remember which challenges I am doing or how far I have progressed in each one. 
* I would like to bookmark articles as well as talks, including the articles from other sources that are suggested at the end of each Shine article. There are times I see an article I’d like to read, but don’t have time. I’d love to be able to save it in Shine to read later. Ditto helpful articles I have read but would like to come back to later.

I like the new design! Definitely enjoying the colors and the absence of “stock people”. I also like the waves of color that climb the screen as each talk progresses and the big gold wave that fills up the screen when I open the app. <U+263A><U+FE0F>

Thank you!

Update from day 35: 

Still enjoying it! 
 * The briefness of the tracks and articles really helps me to fit them into my day. 
 * I like that each day has a few articles and a recommended audio track that get logged onto my feed, allowing me to scroll backwards to check out the ones I didn’t have time for, or to revisit ones that were meaningful. 
* I like the constant reminders in the audio tracks to breathe. Sometime I think “oh this again” but the truth is that every time I take a deep breath I realize how much it helps and how shallow my breathing has been.
 * I like that after I listen to an audio track from a challenge, it is logged on my feed, along with its takeaways. Those little 3-point summaries are very useful. 

Suggestions for the developers:
* Have the summaries for each track include the mantra from the end of the track, because I am never in a spot to write it down and I always forget it! <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>
* The tracking mechanism for the 7-day challenges is wonky. For example: 4 days in, the summary page is displaying tracks out of order, highlighting track 2 as today’s track instead of track 4, and showing that I haven’t listened to track 3. And sometime tracks I have listened to (and have been logged on my feed) show that they are only partially completed.
 * Developers, know that folx might have differing listening habits. Examples: I like to listen to tracks a few times, but I don’t need the track logged to my feed every time I listen to it. It would be great if there was a replay button that simply repeated the track without logging it. Maybe even a “save to feed” button. Sometimes I like to listen to a track 2x in a row, but the navigation to do so is cumbersome. And other times I like to repeat track 2 right before I listen to track 3 - I find the lessons sink in better that way.
 * When I start a 7-day challenge, it would be great if I could opt to receive a reminder to listen to the next track in the series in my iPhone’s Notification Center each day. Sometimes I can’t get back to a challenge for a few days, but having the notifications would help me to keep track of the ones I had missed. Even better if I could Open the notification and it took me right to the track.

"279","Love it","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id373325667","vysgiyi","2.2.1",5,"Update: I decided to give shine a try despite my reservations and I AM SO GLAD I DID. I have definitely seen more and more content added in addition to the great articles. There are definitely a few minor bugs: it doesn’t let me access the app unless I’m connected online even though as a premium member i should have access. And sometimes the morning midday or evening meditations glitch. But despite these small things there’s enough content that even when these don’t work I find great guided meditations that do exactly what I need. I also like that getter all different with different times. It’s so easy to find one to fill my needs and the time I have available. Has become a part of my morning afternoon and evening routines. Couldn’t do without it. Love love love it. 

I honestly love everything about shine. Except one thing. Their content. It’s practically anemic. I admit I currently practice mindfulness meditation for 15-20 min twice a day and am looking for new meditations and new practices. With their 4-8min meditations I could go through the content in a couple weeks. On top of that the daily check ins for morning afternoon and evening seem to be the same every day. Since I practice mindfulness as a way combat stress anxiety and depression this seemed like an AMAZING feature. But two days in and I’m already bored. For such short guided meditations throughout the app and with fee of 9.99/mo I’m shocked at how few meditations there are and how there doesn’t seem to be a lot of new content popping up in the app. Aside from price and content quantity I have to say Shine delivers everywhere else. Their daily check in is awesome. The content they do have is Very Good and the style the narrators use is amazing. The app is gorgeous and has great articles I can read every morning to get me in the right space mentally to start my day. I only wish there was more content, longer meditations, more meditations specifically geared towards activism, a way to find downloaded content (seriously there’s a download button! But where is it now???), a way that my daily check in responses were recorded - an online gratitude journal anyone? And daily positive affirmations ready and waiting for me in my morning text or check in. Honestly this app probably deserves 4 stars but I was so disappointed about the lack of content after signing up for a year subscription I’m probably being a little harsher than warranted. So if you meditate less than I do or maybe just starting your practice this is a great place to start. Seriously great app. Just maybe not for the price with content being where it is.",2019-04-02,"shine"

You areeeee. Yes, you are! Your Monday motivation hack: Talk to yourself like a pet. Seriously."" Seriously? Eat dog food. I initially liked shine for its strategic essays on overcoming daily travails like being overwhelmed by an unachievable to-do list. Now its posts are trite, if not utterly tone deaf because they seem to be written from a place of coddled self-absorbedness. The latest post, about talking to yourself like a pet, is demeaning in its endeavor to encourage patronizing tones on oneself rather than truly home an empowering message. It's the writer's inane strategy based on her realization that she treats her dog better than herself; speaking the language of dumb and basic was never considered a strategy for self respect, which makes this even more asinine. But hey, if someone needs to squeeze out ""good boy!"" rhetoric after defecating, then this is the service for them. Good for Haley, the writer. I hope she finds her sense of self worth in speaking the language of dumb when encouraging herself to get out of bed in the morning.",2019-04-01,"shine"

It reminds me to practice gratitude and take care of myself during daily check ins. I like how it tells you your all time number of check ins, rather than a streak because if I miss a day (which I haven’t yet because it helps so much), I don’t feel guilty for ruining my streak. 

The guided meditation challenges are helpful because they give simple and relatable tips to focus on and practice. The 7 day challenges help keep me focused and working towards self care, mindfulness, and so much more. It’s even helpful for eating healthier and encouraging more exercise into your daily life. Those who record the tracks have very pleasant voices and I always feel better after listening. 

I ended up purchasing the app, and think it is well worth the cost.

One suggestion! When looking through past shine articles, I click through many of the links. It would be nice to be able to go back to the previous shine article you were looking at, rather than back to the home page or check in page. I like to weave through pages, but a lot of time I want to read a few different links from the same article but then have to navigate my way back through the chain. So a simple “back” button would be helpful instead of the arrow clicking “back to home”.

The phone number on the bottom of the receipt goes into a voice mail box that’s not set up. Very unprofessional. 

I did get an auto response from the email I sent yesterday, requesting cancellation. So I have replied to it. Otherwise, I will dispute through American Express.",2019-02-08,"shine"

What I don’t like is that every person narrating is a sounds millennial and I could be their mom. 

I get all excited to try a new episode and then it starts with some kid dishing advice. They need more seasoned narrators. The reason being, when you already made your money, traveled abroad and have already had kids, your perspective is so different that you don’t resonate with a woman half your age saying, “You got this.”",2019-02-07,"shine"
