However the business model changed to prescription..... Now I feel like this is only for those who can afford the $50. This is how personal health becomes out of reach for lower income individuals. Yes, i am a legacy customer, yes I have access to all the old content, but I can no longer recommend this app because I don’t stand behind the price, it’s too high.

 I wish at the very least you could download the new meditations at an individual cost or something at least because having to stay stagnant with only the old content is quite frustrating when you see all the great new topics coming out. I understand it costs money to run this, I understand it’s a business, but the basis of the service is self care and it’s just very disheartening to see all these meditation apps pricing people without at much disposable income out of their apps.",2019-05-21,"meditation_studio"

Meditation Studio has been instrumental in helping me develop my mindfulness and meditation practice, which has helped me through some challenging moments of anxiety and worry. While it is not a cure all, Meditation Studio is a powerful tool well worth its price. It is easy to use and one of my favorite functions is the ability to choose different background music or sounds. Even when I learn to manage the anxiety I am experiencing much better than I currently do, I will continue using Meditation Studio as daily practice for a range of purposes like stress, gratitude, compassion, sleep, and more.

That being said, for the one time Pay, this is definitely a great deal. Or was it free... even better!

"41","It really is the best meditation app","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id11707494","Tappmd","1.22",5,"I have tried a variety of other apps for meditation such as Calm and Omvana. They were ok. I tired of the various ‘asks’ for money in some, the inadequate samples and the lack of variety. 

So I saw a review of this one and the awards it received. I said might as well. And the reviews were absolutely right. They have meditations for all kinds of mental and emotional needs, at various lengths with different teachers. You can even make your own. And it was <$US25 for the year. Some apps charged $US3-8 per meditation and no sample. You can even make your own Or have favorites and play lists. They are easy to sort by length, type, favorites or teachers. 

I made a suggestion once about having a dark background to make it easier on the eyes at night. And they actually did within a few weeks (not that I was the cause of it but I feel like someone listened). And you can now string them together. 

This app has helped me in so many ways to keep my life straight. I wish blessings on the makers.

After complaining about the downloadable content not being accessible, a few days passed and the content began to work properly. I am assuming it was a backend issue with their servers as the app didn’t need an update to work properly. They’ve got my subscription.

Original - 1 Star
I downloaded the app and wanted to try out the free content before making the decision to purchase a subscription. After I download a track, I attempt to play the file and an alert controller as presented showing that the downloaded content was out of date and requires the file to be updated. So then it takes me back out to the original screen where I could download the file again. This logic loop continues no matter how many times I read download the track. I attempted to send an email to support through their website and have yet to hear a reply. I attempted to send a message inside the app to support, but the send button is disabled. Now I am resorting to leaving a bad review in the App Store in hopes of actually getting the issue resolved.

Ever since Gaiam hyperlinked it to their website.  I have tried a few others (Headspace),  what I love about Meditation Studio is 1) Many choices for teachers... I am an aural person, I love hearing someones voice, the quality of their voice, and how just the sound of the voice can be soothing. The recording quality is excellent.  It feels like the person is sitting right next to you.  2) Variety - both short and long meditations from a minute or two to more than 30 minutes. Sometimes you really need and only have time for a few minutes meditation. 3) Many topics - the most important to me, and why I keep returning to this app, some of the meditations are more like coaching sessions— geared towards moving through difficult or stressful moments in life.

I remember being hesitant to start meditating but for any beginners out there who want to start (or even any seasoned meditators) this app is great!

I personally cannot, as much as I would love to, but for anyone thinking that it would stop you from using or loving this app, it doesn’t.

Just guided meditations of seriously varying lengths (say, 4 minutes to 50 minutes..), that are arranged in courses or by purpose (lower stress, go to sleep) or for population (teenagers, first responders).

You can download the ones you like to your ""studio"" though I haven't figured out how to delete them. Maybe they're automatically deleted after a period of unuse. What I REALLY WISH it could do is let you star your favorites or make ""playlists."" Even being able to add your own note to give a description would be helpful.

As another reviewer says, try out different options even if you're not sure if it applies. Openness to the different voices and approaches can only enhance your meditation practice and help you find the one(s) that are most helpful.
