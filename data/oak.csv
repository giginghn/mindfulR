When you are meditating it pauses & it is very annoying to have to keep hitting play to keep it running. It stops playing in the middle of your meditation, which is terrible. This issue really needs to be addressed. If worked better before you started changing & added the mantra course. If you are going to charge-it should work",2019-06-25,"oak"
"2","Mind Blown Away","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id783079164","COWMSNDJAMX","2.5.1",4,"I absolutely love this app. There is no subscription that you have to buy to use it. There is an in app purchase but that’s besides my point. I absolutely would recommend this app. Whenever I’ve had a stressful day I can always count on this awesome app to help. Waking up early? No problem! The sleeping section helps with that. Can’t focus? The breathing section helps with that! Just want to be guided on meditation without having to tap your screen to make sure it’s on? The meditation section helps with that! Here’s a quick story: when I first found this app and saw that you could have rain playing for 55 minutes with you phone off, I had to recommend it to my mom. She loves sleep and falling asleep to rain. It was the best to her! 

Another thing: Since it’s Pride Month I’ll share this. The meditation section REALLY helped me accept my sexuality and gender identification since I was struggling with that and coming to terms with who I was. I was a little ehh about it but doing the I think acceptance breathing meditation course, for a while really helped me come to terms.

Have I proven my point that this is a freakin amazing app yet? Still not convinced? Try it out, see how you like it.",2019-06-23,"oak"

You can choose to have background noise or not and the options are pretty decent for not having to pay money for the app. At first when I saw it, I thought there must be a catch but there isn’t and I am very happy. I believe that apps like this shouldn’t cost money because you shouldn’t have to pay money for something that is supposed to help you.

Developers:
I believe that 5.99 for the mantra course is a little bit to much for only that course I mean, are there any other benefits coming soon if I do the payment? I personally believe it’s to much for just one course.

Also I’d love if you could add more flexibility with the volumes for voice and background; as well as the breathing techniques not necessarily requiring to see the screen;
It would be great to have some type of animation or image of adequate positions for each meditation before starting the meditation itself; for example the loving kindness before beginning, displaying some demonstrations of a position with hands on the heart or just specifying where the heart is and an adequate position to place the hands, something like that would be very helpful. 

Keep up the great work! You’re really making a difference and making meditation so dynamic, the fact that now smartphones got involved as a tool is wonderful! thank you so very much. 

Overall I’m very grateful and in love with this amazing app, community that goes along with it as well,

Yet you need a steady income for food $120 a month. You need a hefty rich income to buy clothes regularly. So I rarely do but clothes manages $40 a month. Then Shelter. Shelter requires $2,000 a month in most places.

So if we NEED these things to survive why do we charge nearly $2,500 for everything monthly.

As the need for us to relax comes greater in the world everyone is looking how they can make money charging people for oxygen and charging people for water they drink.

I miss the calming darker blue background with white clock numbers. I meditate in a low light environment.  The new lighter (white) background is too bright. When I open my eyes to check the countdown timer, it hurts my eyes and the thin-lined black clock numbers are hard to read. Also, when I close my eyes again, I still see the photo image for a few seconds. This brightness is counter intuitive to relaxation. I do like that the makers kept my previous data and that they fixed the breathing counter to go higher than 1k.

UPDATE: July 10, 2018 - I have been manually adjusting the brightness on my iPad app each time I use it and am very happy with the results. I highly recommend it his app often to friends and family.

The newer app seems mottled. I received a developer response to my months-old review below, saying improved logging of breathe sessions was coming in the future. It should already be here by now. Still disappointed with the direction Oak is going.  

According to Oak, if you plan to meditate for 10 min but finish after 8, it’s like you never meditated: you get no credit. Nothing is logged in the app or in Health. This is half-baked and foolish. This is a shame because there’s so much potential. It’s bad enough that all meditation apps  include only the time you log/spend in that app. That focuses on the maker, not the user. #BadUX

The app is generally beautiful, but with too many serious issues. I like the mix of information, breathing and mediation. Unfortunately, only meditation counts for “growing your oak,” even thought Wisdom and Breathing are presented on par with Mediation. Again I question what the developers are thinking.

There is the occasional day I miss, and the notice about ""meditation streaks"" is very unhelpful. It causes me to focus on doing meditation for the wrong reasons. 

I'd love it if I could turn off the streak counter. As it turns my meditation practice from a practice and into a game or competition.

I am LOVING the new guided breath segment for sleep. It’s so helpful! A few things I’d like to see:
1. An option for the guided voice during the breathing exercises. I like using it silently at work if I need a break, so the current setup is perfect. Having the guided voice for the sleep one makes me realize that I’d use the breath ones more at home/at night if I didn’t have to watch the screen to do it. 
2. It would be nice if the guided breath for sleep allowed for a quick “warm up” like the meditations do. It’s hard to turn off lights, hit play, put my phone in its spot, AND get comfortable before the voice starts, and I don’t want to miss anything!!

I just did the Loving Kindness meditation for the first time and loved it — that’s what prompted me to write this review!  And they’ve just added some Sleep exercises/functions that I can’t wait to try!

For the first time I can see I am truly enjoying a mediation app (and I will admit, the fact that there are no “pro” “premium” or subscriptions is partly why I enjoy it; I never liked the idea of profiting off of mediation, it seems ingenuine to me). The app is super clean with a beautiful design. However, from my initial experience, here are two things I would tweak: 
1. The guiding voice is significantly louder than the background noise. I wish there was a way to control the balance between these two. I don’t like the guiding voice to be too loud, but when I adjust the voice volume to my liking the background sound is almost inaudible. 
2. For the breathing exercise, I wish there was an option for an audio guide as well. Just like while meditation, while breathing I prefer to not stare at my screen, but currently there is no way for me to follow the breathing exercises without having my eyes glued to the screen, I hope this will change. 

Overall, this is an excellent mediation app, and I hope it remains clean and bloat free, with non of the “premium” features that are constantly being pushed with similar mediation apps. Thanks for making the world a better place.",2018-07-06,"oak"
